# dotfiles

My Dotfiles
This repo contains dotfiles and scripts to get up and running on a new mac/keep macs in sync.

What is not in this repo:
- Sensitive keys
- projects for `tmux-sessionizer` as these are machine-specific
- inputs for `cht.sh` as these are workflow-specific, different languages for work and personal projects

## Installation

- Clone this repo somewhere, eg `~/Config`
- Run ./install.sh
- Verify output/symlinks are correct
- Ensure ./sessionizer-projects, ~/.chsh-languages and ~/.chsh-utils are present
- Manually add env files for sensitive keys
